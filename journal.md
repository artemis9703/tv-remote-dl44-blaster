# May 20th: the idea

[today i came up with the idea for a universal tv remote and mapped out my plan on a picture of the DL-44. i also started researching into the differences between a RP pico and an arduino. i have settled on an pico and am planning to start on the circuit schematic tomorrow]

# May 22nd: schematicing

[today i loaded up kicad and designed the schematic for my blaster remote. i picked a raspberry pi pico for the microcontroller and decided on the number of buttons required. 12 buttons are necesary: on/off, soucre, volume +/-, channel +/-, up, down, left, right, select, and one to select which kind of tv your using.]
