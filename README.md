# Han Solo's Tv Remote

ive made plans for a tv remote in the shape of han solo's DL-44 blaster. its a replica of the dl44 from star wars, with the guts of a tv remote stuffed inside. it can turn the tv on, change the volume, change the channel, use source/input, and it also has basic directional controls. i will 3d print the casing and order the boards from jlcpcb. 

i got the idea a couple days after highway was announced. we were trying to watch a movie, and our tv remote stopped working. i thought, wouldnt it be so cool to have a theme tv remote that actually works (turns out the batteries were just dead, but what can you do). the first design plan was a wand from harry potter, but then i saw star wars and it turned into han solo's blaster. one month later, and here we are.
